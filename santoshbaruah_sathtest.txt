Instruction are as follows:
1.	public url for test :13.233.127.36 
(May be its not accessible, because I Terminate the Ec2 Instance after Test is over).

2.	I create a Docker Container and name it as santoshbaruah/santoshbaruah_sathtest  for the test .
3.	For the test I followed this steps 
a.	Launch an Amazon Ec2 instance free tire 
b.	Install Docker on it 
c.	Start the Docker container 
d.	Run the following set of command 
e.	Docker run –td -–name santoshbaruah –p 80:80 ubuntu 
f.	Docker ps
g.	Docker port santoshbaruah
h.	Docker exec –it santoshbaruah  /bin.bash
(install apache server and do the configuration)
i.	apt-get install apache2 –y
j.	cd var/www/html
k.	echo “hello world”  >index.html
l.	and then use aws public ip to test the site which at the time of exam provided as 13.233.127.36

4.	As next step I create an image from the container and name it as >
 santoshbaruah_sathtest
5.	In the next step I push that image to my Docker public repo and my pulic GitHub account with instruction.
6.	The image name is  santoshbaruah/santoshbaruah_sathtest
